## Important Literature and Notes

Durlinger et al. (Themmen), 2013
[Control of Primordial Follicle Recruitment by Anti-Müllerian Hormone in the Mouse Ovary](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/endo.140.12.7204)

AMH knockout mice - manuscript includes follicle counts and the perhaps surprising finding that only a subtle acceleration of primordial follicle growth activation manifests in the absence of AMH.

Wallace and Kelsey, 2015
[Human Ovarian Reserve from Conception to the Menopause](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008772)

This is an exciting approach that ..."model[s] the age-related population of NGFs in the human ovary from conception to menopause."

Here is another PLoSONE paper that calculates follicle number within an ovary given volumes occupied by follicles of known size. This paper needs to be discussed in our manuscript ASAP ([Issue 2](https://github.com/johnsonlab/OvSim/issues/2))
